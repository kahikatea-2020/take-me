This is a website where you can list items you no longer want or need, but might still have some value or use to someone else.

## Why Would You Use It?

By using this you are *recycling*. This means:

* You are saving energy - because the manufacturer does not need to make a new product

* Reduces landfill use - if we can reduce the amount of waste in a landfill, we will be better off as a planet

* Reduces the amount of chemicals used - factories use raw materials which create toxic chemicals

* Reduces water polution - if an item is recycled, it will not end up in the ocean

* Saves you money - if you are getting something free from our site, you are not buying something new. As a result, you are saving money!
