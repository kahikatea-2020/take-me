This is a WebSite where you can put items up you don't want to have anymore but still might have some value or use to someone else

## Why Would You Use It?

By using this you are *recycling* this means 

* You are saving energy- Because the manufacture does not need to make a new product

* Reduces landills- If we can cut the amount of waste in a landfill we will be better off as a planet

* Reduces the amount of toxic chemicals used- Factories do use raw materials which create toxic chemicals

* Reduces water polution- If a item is recycled it will not end up in the ociean and production of new materials creates polution

* Saves you money- If you are getting something free from our site you are not buying something new as a result you are saving money
