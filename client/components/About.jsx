        <h2>What is The Point of This Website?</h2>
        <p>
        We want to promote recycling and reusing things that do not need to be thrown out. "one man's trash is another man's treasure"
        Is how our site works. We aim to make it easy to find someone else who wants something you will throw out and give it a second life.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Recycle?</h2>
        <p>
        You have heard of reduce, reuse, recycle right?
        Well, this is another thing that we are trying to do by making this Website.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are saving energy - because the manufacturer does not need to make a new product</li>
          <li>Reduces landfill use - if we can reduce the amount of waste in a landfill, we will be better off as a planet</li>

        </ul>
