        <h2>What is The Point of This Website?</h2>
        <p>
        We want to promote recycling and reusing things that do not need to be thrown out. "one man's trash is another man's treasure"
        Is how our site works. We aim to make it easy to find someone else who wants something you will throw out and give it a second life.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Recycle?</h2>
        <p>
        You have heard of reduce, reuse, recycle right?
        Well, this is another thing that we are trying to do by making this Website.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are saving energy - because the manufacturer does not need to make a new product</li>
          <li>Reduces landfill use - if we can reduce the amount of waste in a landfill, we will be better off as a planet</li>
          <li>Reduces the number of chemicals used - factories use raw materials which create toxic chemicals</li>
          <li>Reduces water pollution - if an item is recycled, it will not end up in the ocean</li>
          <li>Saves you money - if you are getting something free from our site, you are not buying something new. As a result, you are saving money!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
        <p>
          Do not throw stuff out that can find another life. This will keep it out of a landfill.
          You can sign up for our site and list stuff for other people to take and put to another use or pick something up off the site for free.
          If you want to clean out your closet, garage, or clutter why waste it when you can give it away.
          What you do with your rubbish affects the planet and the environment you live in. Because of this, we believe everyone has a personal
          responsibility to look after the planet, so you need to be responsible for how much rubbish you produce and this site can help you reduce it.
